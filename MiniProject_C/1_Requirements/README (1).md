# SWOT Analysis

•	Strength - Unique concept and price money will attract users

•	Weakness - Static set of questions can make users win the game easily. We need to randomize questions in upcoming implementations.

•	Opportunity - Covid pandemic is going on, so this product will help users and this can be scaled in other situations as well where user education is necessary.

•	Threats - If the product works well, it can be implemented by other users, so we need to bring in enhancements frequently to distinguish the product and make it hard to replicate easily.
